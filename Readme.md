Python Challenge

This is a second project for learning Python (alongside the repository 'Learning Python', which follows the course 'Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps' by Mike Kennedy.
While I enjoy the practicle approach that Mike Kennedy pursues, I sometimes find it frustrating to only be coding the apps that he shows, and this project is an attempt to solve Python challenges using what I have learned in Mike's course, but with my own approach.

In this repository I attempt to solve the Python challenges by Michele Pratusevich as found on 'http://www.practicepython.org'.
